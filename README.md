# music_portfolio_website
A website for a client (developer's brother) who wanted a website to show information about himself and his music.
There will be 3 web pages, one called "about me" which shows information about the client, one called "songs" which shows all of the songs that the client has worked on, and one called artists which shows all of the artists that the client has worked with.

This website is built using html, css and material design components.

At time of writing this, the website is not finished and only has one page.
