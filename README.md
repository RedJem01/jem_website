# music_portfolio_website
A website for a my brother (Benjy Stobart) who wanted a website to show information about himself and his music.


This website is built using html, css and bootstrap components.

At time of writing this, the website is not finished.

To run the website, run the following commands:
npm install (to install the package.json packages)
npm start (this runs the sass commands to turn the scss files into css and then runs the website using the serve package)

The link to the website will have copied to your clipboard and you can go to it in any browser.
